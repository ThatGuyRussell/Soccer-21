# Soccer-21
#####What is Soccer | 21?

Soccer | 21 is an exciting, fast-paced soccer multiplayer game allowing up to 21 different players in an online, hectic, and outrageously fun freestyle game all at the same time on their individual cell-phones.  

#####What makes Soccer | 21 Special?

Soccer | 21 runs on your computer, while all the users connect with their phones online! No apps are required, just internet access and a computer running the program! Each user can connect to an individual player in the game by just visiting a predefined website in their browser.  

#####How does this work?

The main part of the game was made in the Unity game engine. All movements and game objects were created and animated in the engine. Using an API provided by EA (Electronic Arts), I was able to use NodeJS to pass JSON data from a webpage to Unity. I then tracked the users finger on the screen of their phone and calculated a direction and speed for their player. Combining the components of the game and the data from the users phone I created an interactive game that can be both simple and addicting to play.
